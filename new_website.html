Some previous studies of the X-ray afterglow have claimed the onset of a new afterglow component or raised concerns about the data processing techniques. Motivated thus, we present here a reanalysis of X-ray afterglow data for GW170817 and find potential sources of discrepancies between the data reduction techniques employed by various research groups. We also analyze the updated panchromatic afterglow data to find that there is no significant evidence for any new afterglow component (e.g. due to the ejecta that gave rise to the kilonova) and that the jet must be still in a mildly relativistic phase. The decline in the afterglow light curve is significantly shallower compared to that expected from the standard synchrotron afterglow jet models with sideways spreading, indicating either an additional energy injection at late times or the velocity dependence on the microphysics parameters. In this context, we discuss the implications of the late time afterglow data on jet dynamics.</p><h2>VLASS-based Survey of Transition State Galaxies and Their Relationship to Compact Peaked-spectrum Radio Sources</h2><p>Authors:Kunert-Bajraszewska, Magdalena,Krauze, Aleksandra,Kimball, Amy E.,Stawarz, Łukasz,Kharb, Preeti,Stern, Daniel,Mooley, Kunal,Nyland, Kristina,Kozieł-Wierzbowska, Dorota</p><p>Published:2025-04-00</p><p>Abstract: We present multifrequency and high-resolution studies of a sample of 24 radio transient sources discovered by comparing the NRAO VLA Sky Survey and the Very Large Array Sky Survey. All of them are characterized by a significant increase in radio flux density over the past two decades. Their convex spectra, small sizes, and high brightness temperatures are typical for young GHz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources and indicative of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) buried in the host galaxy. On the other hand, they are much weaker than the archetypal GPS objects, and their parsec-scale radio structures, although indicating the presence of young radio jets, are similar to radio-quiet AGNs like Seyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies. Based on the distribution of these objects in power‑size (P‑D) and peak frequency‑size (ν<SUB>p</SUB>‑D) diagrams, we suggest that, after stabilizing their radio activity, some of the GHz-peaked radio transients (galaxies and quasars) will develop into radio-intermediate and radio-quiet quasars and low-frequency peaked-spectrum objects. We discuss several possible origins for the transient radio emission in our sources and conclude that changes in the accretion rate combined with low-power radio ejecta are the most probable cause. This is the scenario we also propose for one of our sources, 101841‑13, which was independently identified as a candidate tidal disruption event (TDE) based on its infrared variability. However, we cannot exclude that 101841–13 or other sources in our sample are TDEs.</p></body></html>
