All of them are characterized by a significant increase in radio flux density over the past two decades. Their convex spectra, small sizes, and high brightness temperatures are typical for young GHz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources and indicative of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) buried in the host galaxy. On the other hand, they are much weaker than the archetypal GPS objects, and their parsec-scale radio structures, although indicating the presence of young radio jets, are similar to radio-quiet AGNs like Seyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies. Based on the distribution of these objects in power‑size (P‑D) and peak frequency‑size (ν<SUB>p</SUB>‑D) diagrams, we suggest that, after stabilizing their radio activity, some of the GHz-peaked radio transients (galaxies and quasars) will develop into radio-intermediate and radio-quiet quasars and low-frequency peaked-spectrum objects. We discuss several possible origins for the transient radio emission in our sources and conclude that changes in the accretion rate combined with low-power radio ejecta are the most probable cause. This is the scenario we also propose for one of our sources, 101841‑13, which was independently identified as a candidate tidal disruption event (TDE) based on its infrared variability. However, we cannot exclude that 101841–13 or other sources in our sample are TDEs.</p></div><hr><div class='paper'><h2><a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025MNRAS.tmp..629K' target='_blank'>The Late-time Afterglow of GW170817 and Implications for Jet Dynamics</a></h2><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katira, Aman, Mooley, Kunal P., Hotokezaka, Kenta</p><p><strong>Published:</strong> 2025-04-00</p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> GW170817 is the first binary neutron star merger detected with gravitational and electromagnetic waves, and its afterglow is still detectable 7 years post-merger. Some previous studies of the X-ray afterglow have claimed the onset of a new afterglow component or raised concerns about the data processing techniques. Motivated thus, we present here a reanalysis of X-ray afterglow data for GW170817 and find potential sources of discrepancies between the data reduction techniques employed by various research groups. We also analyze the updated panchromatic afterglow data to find that there is no significant evidence for any new afterglow component (e.g. due to the ejecta that gave rise to the kilonova) and that the jet must be still in a mildly relativistic phase. The decline in the afterglow light curve is significantly shallower compared to that expected from the standard synchrotron afterglow jet models with sideways spreading, indicating either an additional energy injection at late times or the velocity dependence on the microphysics parameters. In this context, we discuss the implications of the late time afterglow data on jet dynamics.</p></div><hr><div class='paper'><h2><a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.532.2820C' target='_blank'>Constraints on short gamma-ray burst physics and their host galaxies from systematic radio follow-up campaigns</a></h2><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chastain, S. I., van der Horst, A. J., Anderson, G. E., Rhodes, L., d'Antonio, D., Bell, M. E., Fender, R. P., Hancock, P. J., Horesh, A., Kouveliotou, C., Mooley, K. P., Rowlinson, A., Vergani, S. D., Wijers, R. A. M. J., Woudt, P. A.</p><p><strong>Published:</strong> 2024-08-00</p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are explosive transients caused by binary mergers of compact objects containing at least one neutron star. Multiwavelength afterglow observations provide constraints on the physical parameters of the jet, its surrounding medium, and the microphysics of the enhanced magnetic fields and accelerated electrons in the blast wave at the front of the jet. The synchrotron radio emission can be tracked for much longer than in other spectral regimes, and it can pin down the evolution of the spectral peak. We present the results of a systematic observing campaign of eight short GRBs with the MeerKAT radio telescope. Additionally, we present observations of four of these short GRBs using the ATCA radio telescope and two of these short GRBs with the e-MERLIN radio telescope. Using these results we report one possible detection of a short GRB afterglow from GRB 230217A and deep upper limits for the rest of our short GRB observations. We use these observations to place constraints on some of the physical parameters, in particular those related to electron acceleration, the circumburst density, and gamma-ray energy efficiency. We discuss how deeper observations with new and upgraded telescopes should be able to determine if the gamma-ray efficiency differs between long and short GRBs. We also report detections of the likely host galaxies for four of the eight GRBs and upper limits for another GRB, increasing the number of detected host galaxies in the radio with implications for the star formation rate in these galaxies.</p></div><hr><div class='paper'><h2><a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...970..139S' target='_blank'>A Radio Flare in the Long-lived Afterglow of the Distant Short GRB 210726A: Energy Injection or a Reverse Shock from Shell Collisions?</a></h2><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Schroeder, Genevieve, Rhodes, Lauren, Laskar, Tanmoy, Nugent, Anya, Rouco Escorial, Alicia, Rastinejad, Jillian C., Fong, Wen-fai, van der Horst, Alexander J., Veres, Péter, Alexander, Kate D., Andersson, Alex, Berger, Edo, Blanchard, Peter K., Chastain, Sarah, Christensen, Lise, Fender, Rob, Green, David A., Groot, Paul, Heywood, Ian, Horesh, Assaf, Izzo, Luca, Kilpatrick, Charles D., Körding, Elmar, Lien, Amy, Malesani, Daniele B., McBride, Vanessa, Mooley, Kunal, Rowlinson, Antonia, Sears, Huei, Stappers, Ben, Tanvir, Nial, Vergani, Susanna D., Wijers, Ralph A. M. J., Williams-Baldwin, David, Woudt, Patrick</p><p><strong>Published:</strong> 2024-08-00</p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present the discovery of the radio afterglow of the short gamma-ray burst (GRB) 210726A, localized to a galaxy at a photometric redshift of z ∼ 2.4. While radio observations commenced ≲1 day after the burst, no radio emission was detected until ∼11 days. The radio afterglow subsequently brightened by a factor of ∼3 in the span of a week, followed by a rapid decay (a "radio flare"). We find that a forward shock afterglow model cannot self-consistently describe the multiwavelength X-ray and radio data, and underpredicts the flux of the radio flare by a factor of ≈5. We find that the addition of substantial energy injection, which increases the isotropic kinetic energy of the burst by a factor of ≈4, or a reverse shock from a shell collision are viable solutions to match the broadband behavior. At z ∼ 2.4, GRB 210726A is among the highest-redshift short GRBs discovered to date, as well as the most luminous in radio and X-rays. Combining and comparing all previous radio afterglow observations of short GRBs, we find that the majority of published radio searches conclude by ≲10 days after the burst, potentially missing these late-rising, luminous radio afterglows.</p></div><hr><div class='paper'><h2><a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024GCN.36390....1E' target='_blank'>GW170817: VLA observations at  5.5 yrs since merger</a></h2><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eddins, A., Balasubramanian, A., Corsi, A., Yadav, D., Hotokezaka, K., Mooley, K.

F.</p><p><strong>Published:</strong> 2024-01-00</p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> As part of a long-term effort to discover radio pulsars associated with Fermi sources, organized by the Fermi PSC, we made targeted observations of the candidates identified in Frail+ (2018MNRAS.475..942F). We observed P86Y3595 on 2017 February 1 (MJD 57785) for 30 minutes at 820MHz with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). We used the GUPPI pulsar backend to record 200MHz of bandwidth with 2048 channels at 61.44μs resolution. A GBT observation of 5 minutes at S-band (on MJD 57806) determined the pulse width at that frequency to be a very narrow 3%. We also obtained a 30 minute observation on MJD 57788 using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in phased-array pulsar mode. We also detected the pulsation in a GBT observation of 2 minutes at 350MHz that had been taken on MJD 56907 as part of the GBNCC survey (Stovall+ 2014ApJ...791...67S). Lastly we obtained a GBT observation of 5hr on MJD 57833. We also obtained five observations of varying duration using the 76m Lovell telescope between 2019 November 15 and 2020 September 21. See Section 3. <P />We made a 122ks observation of PSR J1555-2908 with the NICER X-ray telescope (NICER proposal #2527), with data accumulated from 2019-May-26 (ObsID 2527010101) through 2019-Sept-9 (ObsID 2527010142). See Section 5. <P />We performed differential time-series photometry, through an Sloan Digital Sky Survey r filter, at the position of PSR J1555-2908 using the 2.4m Hiltner telescope of the MDM Observatory on 2018-Jun-12 and -15. Integrations of 5 minutes each were obtained for a total of 7.16hr over the two nights.

HEX-P will launch at a time when the sky is being routinely scanned for transient gravitational wave, electromagnetic and neutrino phenomena that will require the capabilities of a sensitive, broadband X-ray telescope for follow up studies. These include the merger of compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes, stellar explosions, and the birth of new compact objects. A response time to target of opportunity observation requests of &lt;24 hours and a field of regard of 3π steradians will allow HEX-P to probe the accretion and ejecta from these transient phenomena through the study of relativistic outflows and reprocessed emission, provide unique capabilities for understanding jet physics, and potentially revealing the nature of the central engine.</p></div><hr><div class='paper'><h2><a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023GCN.34968....1S' target='_blank'>LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA O4 Landscape</a></h2><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sajayan, Ajisha, Jha, Kaustubh, Mooley, Kunal</p><p><strong>Published:</strong> 2023-11-00</p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The LVK Collaboration has announced over 50 significant GW events in the first ~5.5 months of O4.

The kilonova associated with GW170817 exhibited two distinct components to its ejecta — the disk wind ejecta and the dynamical ejecta, the latter of which is stratified into lanthanide-rich (LR) and lanthanide-poor (LP) components. Recently, proper motion measurements made with the Hubble Space Telescope and Very Long Baseline Interferometry constrained GW170817's viewing angle very precisely to 19-25 deg (Mooley et al. 2018, Mooley et al. 2022). These measurements enable us to make better inferences about the properties of the kilonova ejecta masses, velocities and compositions. We present a new kilonova model grid from the radiative transfer code POSSIS (Bulla et al. 2019) with heating rates consistent with numerical simulations, and parameterized by dynamical ejecta mass and velocity, disk wind ejecta mass and velocity, and the electron fraction at which the dynamical ejecta is stratified into LP and LR regions. Equipped with the precise viewing angle constraint and our new model grid from POSSIS, we derive new constraints on the ejecta properties of GW170817. I will discuss both our updated inference results, and broader implications on r-process nucleosynthesis from kilonovae.</p></div><hr><div class='paper'><h2><a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023eas..conf..676K' target='_blank'>Active galaxies that have become radio-loud</a></h2><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kunert-Bajraszewska, Magdalena, Wołowska, Aleksandra, Mooley, Kunal, Kharb, Preeti, Kimball, Amy</p><p><strong>Published:</strong> 2023-07-00</p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The evolution of extragalactic sources has been an important issue in the study of active galactic nuclei for many years. Numerous observations led to creation of a standard evolutionary model for radio sources, according to which the younger and smaller Gigahertz-Peaked Spectrum (GPS) and Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) sources expand and become large-scale FRI and FRII objects. However, the excess of compact sources in comparison to fully developed radio-galaxies indicates that a part of GPS and CSS sources never evolve into extended structures.Among several explanations for this early cessation of radio activity, there are indications that some sources may be transient objects on timescales of 10^4 - 10^5 years, representing the new population of active galaxies that needs to be explored. We would like to present the preliminary results of a radio study of a group of galaxies that have been observed for the first time by Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (VLASS) . They were undetected in the previous large radio survey (~ 1995) but discovered in the VLASS observations (&gt;2019) to have brightened significantly and become radio-loud sources. They probably transitioned to radio-loud state either as a result of the increase in radio power or its ignition. These sources represent a new group of AGNs that have not been thoroughly researched so far and may exhibit behaviour typical of many objects of this class.</p></div><hr>
